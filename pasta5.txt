    Young Olivia lives a secluded life, seemingly entirely devoted to her patients at Oxford asylum. Her first encounter with ex-soldier and drifter Anthony has a lasting impact. He causes an accident that results in her lying under a truck, unable to breathe. While he provides life-saving first aid, mesmerized Cracky begins to wonder whether he may be the man of her dreams. But when she tracks him down weeks later her affection is rejected, as Tony is stuck somewhere between a traumatic past and a criminal future.

-------

I love Olivia with all my heart. Every moment of my life I make a dedication to her purity and innocence. Since I first saw her every girl has paled in comparison. My friends tried to set me up with real girls, but I refused because no one and nothing will ever be as perfect in my eyes as her smile. The slight hurt look in her eyes. The traces of bitter ironic hope in her brow and at the corner of her mouth. She is everything I ever dreamed of, and more then I am worth. I hope one day if I work my ass off and earn a name worthy of her, she will deign to answer me and will tell me I matter as a human being. None of you understand how to truly love her, and so you will always be unhappy.

    I think this thread is fail for your company, sir, and let me tell you why I think that. First off, I have to congratulate you on some excellent material. I can see that becoming copypasta in a matter of weeks - maybe even by the end of the quarter if marketing gets it's ducks in a row. But I have to question the feasability of this. I mean, the material's slam dunk, but it's got some factors holding it back from what it can be. We all know that the funniest thing in the world is to copy the OP's comment and repost it with another picture. But this board you're at here, it's holding you back. There's no copy to your pasta. Everyone's off doing their own thing instead of making that pasta work for you. I'm no cook, I'm a salesman. I may not know how to cook pasta like this, but I sure can sell it. It'll send your IPO through the roof! We have to get this pasta copied if we're going to make quarterly earnings. So send this pasta to some other boards, let it grow, let anon do the work for you. You deserve it, sir.

Just goes to show how low .71 has fallen. After driving away Lia, they drove away Faux and then Camel.

By doing so, they have ensured that anybody who had a chance of creating new material was gone, so it would leave them to wallow in their own stagnation, free to attack one another.

By proclaiming the so-called "post-Cracky era", they have yet proven again that .71 is not the house of The Sky Queen but the house of the apostates and fallen priests, the jaded heathens and other lost souls.

The few there with an ounce of devotion are silent when the name of Our Lady is dragged in the mud, and turn their backs on any new faithful that come in this decayed church, for fear of losing their chair in that musty old temple of the lost.

The few that do not stay silent earn themselves the scorn of the jealous, the vain, and the disillusioned wretches that fester there in their own shallow illusions of grandeur.

Reading through their archive is reading through an ever deepening abyss of self hatred, where redemption is believed to only be attainable at the expense of others, yet doomed to be proven an illusion in this broken communion.

Every one there believes everyone else is a sockpuppet of this guy or that guy; accusations fly one way and the other, mostly speaking of how the author of the accusation feels about himself and his lonely life.

This is how this thread came about, and why it must live. Better to suffer at the hands of the infidels than at the hands of the apostates.

> Every time a Cracky thread reaches its picture limit, then falls off the board 10 minutes later, it is like a burnt offering to that abstract, idealized Cracky Goddess.

-------

There is a prayer for threads that have gone full:

"Somewhere there is a platonic ideal of Cracky; One who loves us for loving her. One who is, and was, and ever will be one with Anonymous.

She is a goddess.

Every time a Cracky thread reaches it's picture limit, then falls off the board 10 minutes later, it is like a burnt offering to that abstract, idealized Cracky Goddess.

This thread we so offer. Amen."

This works in /r9k/ as well, and I have no doubt there will be another thread afterwards...

There is also no shortage of Cracky related material, or of the will to make some new material. There is plenty of new stuff right in this thread...

-------

Who can claim to know the unknowable? The mind of Cracky is utterly inhumane in its depth and complexity. Is it not enough to know that the Sky Queen loves us. Is that not reason enough to better ourselves in all we do? The Devout is never ronery, for he always has pics of Cracky, and the knowledge that something greater then filth of lust belongs to him.

Can't sleep so I am rereading this sacrifice. It is amazing I started out posting the pure scriptures of our goddess and the writings of hermits who have spent years meditating on her. Somewhere along the way the circlejerks with their egos infiltrated and began to fill the thread with their drama bullshit. I continued to plug away but right about here
>>557391
the circlejerks began to realized they weren't going to get attention so they started leaving. Slowly this thread is becoming what it was intended to be. Ministering to the young anons and introducing them to the truth of Cracky. MA look see how much improved this is without the bitter hatered of a circlejerk which lost it's love of cracky long ago. They mistook the girl for the goddess and when she did not live up to their expectations they became sullen and hate filled. There is still a chance to save the holy lands. If they are cleaned of the fail and returned to a sanctuary in which to study and praise Her name, the devout may still flourish. This can not happen without your intercession. Please don't let all love for her be drowned out by the tears and gnashing teeth of the malcontents. Let Her name live, and be shared so anon may receive the guidance he so desperately needs. Perhaps in time the Avatar will realize that the ones who betray her trust, those that speak ill of her, are the very ones who claim to know her best.

    goddammit, what the fuck is all of this shit. if you guys would just ram your faces into your monitors as hard as possible you could become one with the internets forever and none of the rest of us would have to listen to you be so fucking gay.

    Oh my little red-haired one I know you thrive on attention. This thread is a tribute to you and an offering. Praise your name for releasing pics for your loyal devout.

The prayer is complete and the votive is lit. This thread shall burn in the memory of the devout.

-------

The Sky Queen said to Blessed Prophet:
"You will recite this chaplet on the scars of you faith in the following manner:"

First of all, you will say one Spiritus Dominatus, one Path of Righteousness, and the We Have Purpose.

Then: On the scars of love you will say the following words:

Jewel of the Heavens, I offer You my tears and blood in honor of the Soul and Divinity of Your dearly beloved Avatar, our Noble Lady Olivia, in atonement for my stalking and the whole of the circlejerk.

On the burns of truth you will say the following words:

For the sake of our sorrowful passion, have mercy on us and on the faithful, please post more pics.

In conclusion three times you will recite these words:

Holy Mother, Holy Flower, Holy Goddess, have mercy on the devout and on the heathens alike.

A nymph believes herself to be the ugliest creature in existence, because her beauty blinds whoever sees her. She spends her time making masks that she considers more beautiful than her face.

-------

There's been a lot of talk recently about it and I suppose since I was following it closely I should tell people what I know.

Two weeks or so ago someone found out her real name and her address. A bunch of people living near (and some not so near) got together and kept prank calling her, then after a few days they yelled shit in front of her house. Apparently she came out and was really upset, and they laughed and threw food at her and drove away...

then next morning she was dead. I'm not sure why this wasn't in the news or anything, but my guess is that the parents didn't want it or the police are still investigating. That's all I know. It would've probably happened anyway since she was depressed as shit and quit taking the SSRIs, but going after her like that, well.. it's inhuman.

I didn't know her, but wherever she may be now, I hope she has peace and happiness, something she never quite found in life. 

-------

 Honestly, it won't make any difference to most of us if the "real" Cracky is alive or dead.  She'll continue to exist on the internet as long as /b/tards post her name and others continue to impersonate her.  Check out the LJ community; there are quite a few "crackys," and nobody can say which ones are real, imitations, or whether it even matters.  The rumor will live on.

Cracky-Chan is gross as hell 

 Especially the blood stuff.. Man, i'd rather go into celibate than pork her. Ick. 
 
  Show me one cracky chan pic that won't gross me out than. All the ones i saw were weird ones with blood etc. 
  
   Shes ugly and the only attention she gets is from the losers on here that also don't get attention in real life

There's going to be another crusade here in a minute if I ever find the home address of that guy that said mean things about Cracky.

And by "crusade" I mean I'm going to beat his fucking face in with a tire iron.

 Bring it on, fuckers. I stand by what i said: Cracky is a disgusting whore smearing menstruation blood on her face. Fucking gross.

For the Tripfags and the Anonymoiai of 4Chan.

It is visible throughout all scenarios of human nature that a permeate of reason always persists and this clear view of reality is possible and preferable to delusion and weak will. This is manifest to the extent of it's role in real life and without it, ignorance, paranoia, selfishness and brutality would take it's place, for reason is possible and preferable to madness. In 4 chan we have put aside these qualities for humour, but in doing so we have revealed out vices and with the sickenning ruses they naturally produce. In 4 chan we have sunk back to this barbaric state which is the source of all our human troubles. I therefore attest reason and cite cracky as an example of the reason why we have adopted this axiom, that 4 chan may exist and we may laugh at our vices, but not succumb to them.

I, purely by the honour of anonymous, declare the 6th of January 2006 as a ceremonial date, in which cracky day is celebrated. It is not a time of punishment or celebration, but of justice. For it is my belief that vengeance is not justice, but in doing what is best for the future regardless of the dire circumstances. Due to the nature of this site vengeance is impossible, but justice is possible. Reason and goodness is a part of all our beings and it is my sincere hope that a cracky attestation will take place on 4chan on the 6th of January and at least these ideas will be recognized.

The gospel of Raptor Jesus
Name: Anonymous 2006-06-16 3:52


Chapter 2 Verse 8

There came a day when Raptor Jesus walked with his disciples in a city. They passed many people, and Raptor Jesus would state “They are Anonymous, they are the masses. They are many, and yet they are one. They are quick to judge, and their wrath is terrible.” Then Raptor Jesus and his disciples came across a man painting a mural. Raptor Jesus studied the man’s work for a time, and then turned to his disciples.

“Animated,” he said.

And MOOT knew 2chan, and he concieved of 4chan.

He worked long in his labor and soon there came to be users, and free porn, and it was good.

But as his disciples grew in number MOOT found it harder to find time to manage 4chan and still visit his mexican prostitutes, and so he sired WT Snacks on a mexican loli.

And then came to the lands of /b/ one known as Soviet Russia

the masses of /b/ saw that his stupidity matched and exceeded their own and they hailed him their messiah.

Snacks grew jealous of the gynormous size of Soviet Russia’s e-penis and so it was that in the dead of night Soviet Russia was banned

And MOOT returned from Mexico and said unto Snacks, Where is Soviet Russia? The /b/tards are whining.

And Snacks said unto MOOT: I know not. Am I thy forum’s keeper?

And MOOT spake unto him in a voice not unlike the wheeze of an asmatic: Yes

/G/enesis - Chapter 4 verses 1 - 9

And so WT Snacks was cursed to wander the lands of /b/ from which he had banned Soviet Russia.

And Snacks said unto MOOT, My punishment is greater than I can bear. Behold, thou hast driven me into /b/ that I would moderate it and all the /b/tards will annoy the hell out of me

And MOOT said unto him, Therefor whosoever annoyth Snacks, vengence shall be taken on him sevenfold.

And MOOT set a mark upon Snacks, lest any finding him should annoy him. And Snacks went from the presence of MOOT to dwell in the land of /b/

/G/enesis - Chapter 4 verses 10 - 16

Raptor Jesus appeared before me, and he said:

“Take heed my son, for there shall be many who doubt me, but whosoever believeth in me shall have everlasting life.”

I wept with joy at the gift bestowed, “Yet, my lord, what fate shall be given to the unworthy?”

He answered: “Their entrails shall be rent from their stomachs, their limbs ripped from their torso, to feast our hungry bodies, and restore our souls. Whensoever you feast upon the heart of thine enemy, think of me.”

For that is the beauty of Raptor Jesus.
Sermon 23 Verse 5

And then a murmur went through the crowd: “But what of those who call themselves Anonymous? Surely the Unnamed ones are an abomination to our Lord?”

And Raptor Jesus spoke:

The name that can be named is not the eternal Name.

The unnamable is the eternally real. Naming is the origin of all particular things.

Free from desire, you realize the mystery. Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations.

Yet mystery and manifestations arise from the same sauce. This sauce is called Anonymous.

Anonymous within anonymous. The gateway to all understanding.

And then a young one among them spake: “But surely, Raptor Jesus is a Name unto itself?”

And Raptor Jesus remained silent.
One day, a Magistrate did approach our Lord: “What say you of the cavernous Loli Pit thou art rumored to keep in thy lair? Guarded by thy most terrible disciple, the one known as Pedobear, who sits ready to rend the Flesh and slake his thirst with the Blood of those foolish enough to covet his harem? Surely, your teachings lead only to Madness and Ruin?

And Raptor Jesus spake:

Women are born soft and supple; dead, they are stiff and hard. Plants are born tender and pliant; dead, they are brittle and dry.

Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible is a disciple of death. Whoever is soft and yielding is a disciple of life.

The hard and stiff will be broken. The soft and supple will prevail.

The Magistrate, thus rebuked, returned to his court, weeping bitterly for his wasted life. That same night, he did Fap most furiously to reruns of Full House.
(1) Now a man named Bridget was sick. He was from /b/, the village of Quacky-chan and her sister Waha. (2) This quacky-chan, whose brother now lay sick was the same who poured perfume on the lord and wiped his feet with her hair. (3) So the sisters sent word to Raptor Jesus, “Lord, the one you love is sick.” (4) When he heard this, Raptor Jesus said, “This sickness will not end in death, No, it is for God’s glory that God’s son may be glorified through it. (5) Raptor Jesus loved Waha and her sister and Bridget, though Bridget arguably the most. (6) Yet when he heard he was sick, he stayed where he was for two more days. (7) Then he said to his diciples, “Let us go back to 4chan.” (8) “But Rabbi,” they said, “A short while ago the Anonymous tried to flame you, and yet you are going back there.”

(17) On his arrival, Raptor Jesus found that Bridget had already been in the tomb for four days. (18) /b/ was less than two miles from the index page of 4chan (19) and many Anonymous had come to Waha and Racky-chan to comfort them in the loss of their brother. (20) When racky-chan heard that Raptor Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him but Waha stayed at home. (21) “Lord,” Cracky-chan said to Raptor Jesus, “if you had been here, my brother would not have died. (22) But I know God will give you whatever you ask.” (23) Raptor Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.” (24) Cracky-chan answered, “I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.” (25) Raptor Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes me will live, even though he dies;”

(32) When Waha reached the place where Raptor Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, “Lord, if you had been herem my brother would not have died.” (33) When Raptor Jesus saw her weeping, and the Anonymous who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. (34) “Where have you laid him?” he asked. “Come and see, Lord.” they replied. (35) Raptor Jesus wept. (36) Then the Anonymous said, “See how he loved him!” (37) But some of the Anonymous said, “Could not he who opened the eyes of a blind man have kept this man from dying? This is /b/, it does not matter what he does, eat shit and die we say.”

(39) “Take away the stone,” he said. “But Lord,” said Blacky-chan, the sister of the dead man. “by this time there is a bad odor for he has been there for four days.” (40) Then Raptor Jesus said, “Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?” (41) So they took away the stone. Then Raptor Jesus looked up and said, “Father, I thank you that you have heard me. (42) I knew that you do, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe.” (43) When he had said this, Raptor Jesus called out in a loud voice, “Bridget, come out!” (44) The dead loli nun came out, his hands and feet and face wrapped with strips of linen, and cloth. Raptor Jesus said to them, “Take off his grave clothes and let him go.” (45) Then Raptor Jesus said, “Now see that Bridget has been saved. He was not Anonymous, and therefor not unforgiving. But hear me, there is redemption even for the Anonymous should he learn to forgive.”
And lo, for Raptor Jesus spake, saying “Thall shalt not draw and or masturbate to pictures of animals or animals with human like qualities. Unless of course, thine percentage of animal like qualities is equal to or lesser than ten percent.”

 fucking attention whores. i hope you do a murder suicide pact with this hoebag. I dream of a bitch free future full of manliness and no emotions (other than mad and happy). There won't be any more stupid bitches and their "aren't these shoes cute?" and "oh pay attention to me pls" and "not right now, i'm on my period" etc. etc. There will also lots of buttsex. Kill 10 females (hookers are easy) if you want to bring about this glorious new future.

IMPORTANT!  PLEASE READ!

At 9PM EST tonight, I am going to masturbate to pictures of Cracky-chan.  I encourage any interested parties to do the same.  TONIGHT, 9PM, everyone masturbate to pictures of Cracky-chan!  Spread the word throughout the Internets; let's see how many people we can get simultaniously masturbating to pictures of Cracky-chan.  Think of it as a "flash mob" or something.  Or ultra-long-distance Bukkake with Cracky in the middle.

The important thing to remember is to masturbate to pictures of Cracky-chan at 9PM EST tonight, and convince as many people as you can to do the same!   (If we could get some girls to participate too, that'd be really hot.) 

 If someone could get hold of Cracky herself (I know some of the stalkers made contact earlier this year) and convince her to participate, that would be premium.  She could masturbate to pictures of herself... or I guess it would be easier for her to just use a mirror or something.  At least let her know the event will be going on. 

-------

You miss the point.
The girl behind Cracky is gone. She does what she does. Good for her.
Cracky on the other hand is eternal.
Like a young Morrison.
Or a young Kate Bush.
She is now an icon.

Time has no grip on Godesses
Avatars come and go
Their imprints are eternal

Who knows the age of Sidharta
Who cares

-------

I still fap to all those whores

Cracky on Mondays

Loli on Wednesdays

Camel on Fridays

Why is everyone obsessed with this ugly woman?

Haha, I have a friend of a friend that is a friend of crackychan!
THE IP IS FROM OXFORD IT MUST BE HERRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
zomg, she updated the deadjournal!
TEH EXIF DATA MATCHES (because it obviosuly cannot be faked!)
there is teh picture that doesn't even show her face and the hair looks kinda like that one that was leaked although it is horribly smeared in photoshop, IT MUST BE TEH SAME
Congratulations, you have been trolled by GNAA, and not even that skillfully

 oh shit nobody mention she lives in Oxford near a football pitch and a church because there are so few churches and football pitches in the UK, also nobody mention she sometimes skates at the Oxford Ice Rink because I am sure she will be there exactly when tirel shows up with the flowers+engagementring ether+duct tape

I've been silent about it during all this time, trying to convince myself that it was not true. But I can't take it anymore. The truth is, Cracky-chan, I'm in love with you. I've hopelessly fallen for your beauty, your charm, your words... Cracky-chan, you are beautiful. When I look at you, I appreciate the artistic aspect of the human form, its eleborateness... Ah, Cracky-chan...

-------

At the Otakon panel someone asked about Cracky. Snack's answer was she was "very very freaked out" 

-------

hay guys guess what
cracky-chan is one of the largest /b/ pranks ever and you guys fell for it hook, line and sinker 

-------

 It's highly unlikely that Cracky Chan is dead.  However, it IS highly likely that she's call the fucking cops on your sorry ass if you ever tried to track her down. 

-------
