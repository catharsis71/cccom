If you have been redirected here, your IP is probably on the Crowdsec Community Blocklist or the GreenSnow blacklist.

So maybe you should look into that?

Or, less likely, I manually banned your IP for some reason, but if that happened you probably already know what you did.

If you are a legitimate follower of the upward regent, send an e-mail or hit the contact form or post on one of the boards or hit #/r/ on EFnet or ask on the Discord server.
