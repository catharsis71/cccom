If you were redirected here, you probably sent a very strange HTTP request to one of my servers.

Now you are here, on a Cloudflare Pages site, where your very strange HTTP requests are someone else's problem.

This is only intended for bots and other such subhumans.

If any actual crackyfolx somehow end up here (not counting finding the file by stalking the GitHub repo) please tell me what you were doing.
